TITLE :Rock vs Mine Prediction
The motivation behind this project stems from the desire to apply machine learning to solve real-world classification problems. Sonar data is often used in underwater object detection, where classifying objects correctly (such as distinguishing between mines and rocks) is crucial. Machine learning - helps automate this process with a high level of accuracy.
This project was built to demonstrate how data processing, logistic regression, and evaluation metrics like accuracy can be applied to a real dataset. It serves as a practical example for exploring how supervised learning models can classify objects based on input featuresâ€”in this case, the sonar data.
The project solves the problem of classifying sonar signals into two categories: mines or rocks.
In a real-world scenario, this could be used for underwater exploration or Military applications, where distinguishing between DANGEROUS objects like mines and harmless objects like rocks is critical.
Through this project, I learned how to:
Load and explore datasets using Pandas.
Preprocess the data by splitting it into training and testing sets.
Apply Logistic Regression as a classification algorithm.
Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy_score.
Understand the workflow of machine learning: data loading, model training, prediction, and evaluation.
